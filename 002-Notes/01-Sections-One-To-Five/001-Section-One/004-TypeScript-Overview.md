## TypeScript Overview

    - TypeScript = JavaScript + A type system

    - The TS System:
      - Helps us catch errors during development
      - Uses type annotations to analyze our code
      - Only active during development
      - No performance optimization

    - TypeScript Lifecycle:
      1. TypeScript Code (JavaScript w/ Type Annotations)
      2. TypeScript Compiler
      3. Plain Old JavaScript
      4. Browser Executes plain JavaScript, does not know what TypeScript is.

## Summary

    - Writing TypeScript is the same as JavaScript with "extra documentation"
    - TypeScript has no effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or node.
    - It is best to think of TypeScript as being like a friend sitting behind you while coding.
