### Why do we care?

    - TypeScript can do type inference when extracting values from an array.
    - TypeScript can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array.
    - We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' functions.
    - Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types.
