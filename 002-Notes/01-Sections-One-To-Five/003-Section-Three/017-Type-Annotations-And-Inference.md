# Type Annotations and Type Inference

    1. Variables
    2. Functions
    3. Objects

## Type Annotations

    - Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to

## Type Inference

    - TypeScript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

## What's the difference?

    - Type Annotations: We tell TypeScript the type
    - Type Inference: TypeScript guesses the type.
